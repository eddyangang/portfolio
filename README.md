## Experience
[August 2019- December 2019] KiwiBot, Berkeley, CA - Robot Technician
- Designed the state machine architecture of a motion controller for a seven axis tomography system on
LabView, integrated an intuitive UI for controlling each axis, and established serial communication via
ethernet to the motion controller. Keeping daily reports with a research journal.

[September 2019- December 2019] iDentical, San Francisco, CA - Mechanical Engineering Researcher
- Manufactured teeth implants by 3D scanning teeth, developing CAD models of teeth implants, and using
subtractive manufacturing techniques to produce titanium teeth replicas with millimeter tolerance
- Determined root causes of failure using statistical methods and recommend changes in designs, tolerances,
or processing methods.

[June 2019 - August 2019] UC Berkeley FLOW Lab, Berkeley CA - Research Assistant 
- Designed the state machine architecture of a motion controller for a seven axis tomography system on
LabView, integrated an intuitive UI for controlling each axis, and established serial communication via
ethernet to the motion controller. Keeping daily reports with a research journal.

## Projects

[September 2020] Quizzly
- A full-stack MERN web application used to gamify studying with friends. I developed the backend end
game logic, created APIs, and used socket.io to develop a real-time game server. Incorporated Firebase for
user Authentication, and developed a scraper to extract data from pre-existing sites to quickly allow users
to populate their database

[November 2019] Autonomous driving Micromouse
- Designed and built the electrical system of a micromouse vehicle. Programmed PID controllers on an
arduino nano to allow the vehicle to adjust for deviations when cruising straight or turning. Used a PID
controller to allow the vehicle to follow a wall. Incorporated a Flood-fill algorithm to find the best path
within a maze and have the micromouse follow that trajectory.

[October 2019] Controller for UAV 
- Incorporated a cascaded feedback controller to allow a crazyflie quadcopter to hover at steady-state.
Developed vertical, horizontal, and altitude estimators using predictor-corrector models to reduce noise and
bias from measurements. Developed a mathematical model of the mixer matrix to determine PWM outputs
of each motor for given commands.

[May 2019] Real-time, multitasking, remote controlled Hovercraft 
- Designed a CAD model of hovercraft using three directional quadcopter fans, and one lift fan on
Solidworks. Established the state machine architecture and an intuitive GUI that allows for mouse actions
and directional buttons on the keyboard to control hovercraft.
in real-time.
